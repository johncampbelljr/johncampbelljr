                        <h3>mSpoke, Inc., November 2006 - December 2009</h3>
                        <p>Lead Architect/Director of Engineering</p>
			<p>
				Lead a team of eight engineers, reported to the CTO.  Responsible for product coodination, development planning and development execution (scrum-master).
			</p>
				mSpoke was a venture capital funded startup that addressed information overload by creating personalized news filters utilizing machine-learning and information retrieval technologies.  The mSpoke system would learn your reading habits and cull best articles from a set of news sources.  The system parsed and categorized hundreds of thousands of news sources.  The system, written mostly in java, used a distributed message-based architecture that enabled efficient processing of the news sources and learning algorithms. mSpoke's technology was acquired by LinkedIn.
</p><p>
I started off as an engineer/architect and eventually took over scrum-master and director of engineering responsibilities.
